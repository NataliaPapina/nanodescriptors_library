nanoparticles (using x = 0.43 as example) is as follows: 0.903 g (1 mmol) of iron oleate (synthesized
in a typical method) and 0.104 g (0.167 mmol) manganese oleate were dissolved in 15mL of
1-octadecene, with the addition of 0.186 mL (0.584 mmol) of oleic acid. The solution was first kept
at 120 °C for 30 min in vacuum to remove air and other impurities then refluxed at 320 °C in N2 for
2 h before cooling to room temperature. The products were separated by centrifugation, washed three
times with ethanol, and dispersed in hexane for further use. The preparation of Fe3O4 nanoparticles is
similar to the procedure without the adding of manganese oleate.",thermal decomposition,,,,,,,,,crystalline,inverse spinel structures of magnetite,,TEM,,-,0.300,18.500,18.500,18.500,18.500,spherical,,,,,,,,,MTT,SMMC-7721,no,100.000,,,,,,,,,300.000,50000.000,75.600,0.000,0.000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7.000,0.500,904.400,,,,,,,,,,,,,

by aqueous NaBH4 via combination of two water-in-oil microemulsion solutions.
Each micro-emulsion solution contains a surfactant: cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide
(CTAB); a co-surfactant: n-butanol; an oil phase: n-octane, and a water phase. Their water
phases are 0.20M FeCl3 and 0.80M NaBH4, respectively. To prepare the microemulsions,
CTAB was combined with n-octane and n-butanol in two flasks. FeCl3 and NaBH4 water
solutions were prepared separately and then mixed with oil phase in the flasks. In each
microemulsion solution, the molar ratio between the surfactants and oil phase was fixed as:
CTAB : n-butanol : n-Octane = 1:4.1:11.7, and the volume ratio between oil phase and water
phase (O/W) was varied from 7:1 to 1.3:1, for the synthesis of iron nanoparticles with
different size and magnetic properties.",microemulsion method,,,,Ar,,,https://aip.scitation.org/doi/full/10.1063/1.2746064,,,,,TEM,200.000,,,8.000,8.000,8.000,8.000,sphere,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,300.000,10.000,55.000,69.000,,,,,,,,,,,,150.000,0.250,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

one of NaBH4, using de-ionized degassed water. Each is
added to the emulsifier and stirred vigorously under flowing
argon for 30 min. The 0.08M metal containing micelle FeCl3
solution is placed in a 300 ml flask. The 0.2M reducing
NaBH4 solution is added dropwise to the reaction flask while
vigorously stirring. The solution turns black immediately
with evolution of hydrogen gas. The precipitated particles
are separated using a high speed centrifuge. The precipitate
is then washed with de-ionized water three times, followed
by washes in methanol and acetone to ensure the complete
removal of any oil, surfactant, and unreacted cations from
the particles. Since the particles are strongly pyrophoric, care
was taken to spread the particles gently. After washing, the
specimens are subjected to a few hours in an Ar+air atmosphere to passivate the surface. Passivation produces the
iron/iron oxide core/shell structure. The passivated particles
are then redispersed in methanol by adding the methanol and
shaking ultrasonically",,,,,Ar,,,https://aip.scitation.org/doi/full/10.1063/1.2746064,,,bcc -Fe+ fcc Fe3O4,,TEM,,,,10.000,10.000,10.000,10.000,sphere,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,300.000,7.500,95.500,28.000,4.000,,,,,,,,,,,150.000,0.250,345.000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

iron(III) acetylacetonate with 0.69 g (4 mmols) of decanoic acid
and 3 mL of dibenzyl ether (DBE) were dissolved in 22 mL of
squalane. After degassing for 120 minutes at 65 C, the mixture
was heated up to 200 C (3 C /min
) and kept at this value for
2.5 h (a shorter “ageing time” at 200 C led to lower reproducibility as well as to broadening of the size and shape distributions of the nal particles). The temperature was then increased at a heating rate of 7 C / min up to 310 C or reflux temperature
and maintained at this value for 1 h. After cooling down
to room temperature, 60 mL of acetone were added and the
solution was centrifuged at 8500 rpm. The supernatant was then discarded and the black precipitate was dispersed in 2–3 mL of chloroform: this washing procedure was repeated at least two more times. Finally, the collected particles were dispersed in
15 mL of chloroform. By varying the ratio between DBE and
squalane, while keeping the other parameters constant, smaller
particles could be synthesized. For instance, 38  4 nm, 26
3 nm, 21  2 nm and 14  2 nm nanocubes were synthesized by
using 21 mL of squalane and 4 mL of DBE, 18 mL of squalane
and 7 mL of DBE, 16 mL of squalane and 9 mL of DBE and 23 mL of DBE and 2 mL of squalane, respectively (Fig. 2 and S1†). It is

and 7 mL of DBE, 16 mL of squalane and 9 mL of DBE and 23 mL of DBE and 2 mL of squalane, respectively (Fig. 2 and S1†). It is

found the system to be very sensitive to moisture/air. In all the syntheses, we applied vacuum for 120 minutes at 0.1 mbar and at
a temperature of 65C. 

 2) Transfer of iron oxide nanocrystals into polar solvents
After reducing the temperature of the reaction
mixture from 310 to 70 C, 15 mL GA-PEG solution (0.1 M in
chloroform containing 1 mL triethylamine) was injected and
the resulting mixture was stirred overnight at constant
temperature. Then the mixture was allowed to cool to room
temperature and was transferred to a separating funnel.
10 mL of de-ionized water were added, which led to the
formation of two phases. Aer emulsification by means of shaking, the phases were allowed to separate and the aqueous
phase containing the IONP bearing GA-PEG was collected.
This step was repeated until all nanocubes were transferred
into water. After the solution was concentrated under reduced
pressure at 40 C to a nal volume of about 50 mL, the excess
of GA-PEG was removed by dialysis versus 5 L de-ionized water,
using cellulose membrane tubing with a pore size of 50 kDa.
The sample was le in dialysis overnight at room temperature.
This step was repeated 5 times. Finally, the nanocube solution
was concentrated by centrifugation in a centrifuge aflter
(molecular cut-off point 100 kDa) and analysed by FTIR, DLS,
TEM and TGA.",,,,,,,,,,,,,TEM,200.000,,,35.000,35.000,35.000,35.000,cube,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,300.000,70.000,88.000,23.000,,,,,,,,,,,,202.377,0.109,42.308,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

and 3 mL of dibenzyl ether (DBE) were dissolved in 22 mL of

was heated up to 200 C (3 C /min

and maintained at this value for 1 h. After cooling down
to room temperature, 60 mL of acetone were added and the
solution was centrifuged at 8500 rpm. The supernatant was then discarded and the black precipitate was dispersed in 2–3 mL of chloroform: this washing procedure was repeated at least two more times. Finally, the collected particles were dispersed in

ether/squalane ratio
Briefly, in a 50 mL three neck flask, 0.353 g (1 mmol) of
iron(III) acetylacetonate with 0.69 g (4 mmols) of decanoic acid
and 3 mL of dibenzyl ether (DBE) were dissolved in 22 mL of
squalane. After degassing for 120 minutes at 65 C, the mixture
was heated up to 200 C (3 C /min
) and kept at this value for
2.5 h (a shorter “ageing time” at 200 C led to lower reproducibility as well as to broadening of the size and shape distributions of the nal particles). The temperature was then increased at a heating rate of 7 C / min up to 310 C or reflux temperature
and maintained at this value for 1 h. After cooling down
to room temperature, 60 mL of acetone were added and the
solution was centrifuged at 8500 rpm. The supernatant was then discarded and the black precipitate was dispersed in 2–3 mL of chloroform: this washing procedure was repeated at least two more times. Finally, the collected particles were dispersed in
15 mL of chloroform. By varying the ratio between DBE and
squalane, while keeping the other parameters constant, smaller
particles could be synthesized. For instance, 38  4 nm, 26
3 nm, 21  2 nm and 14  2 nm nanocubes were synthesized by
using 21 mL of squalane and 4 mL of DBE, 18 mL of squalane
and 7 mL of DBE, 16 mL of squalane and 9 mL of DBE and 23 mL of DBE and 2 mL of squalane, respectively (Fig. 2 and S1†). It is

found the system to be very sensitive to moisture/air. In all the syntheses, we applied vacuum for 120 minutes at 0.1 mbar and at
a temperature of 65C.

After reducing the temperature of the reaction

the resulting mixture was stirred overnight at constant
temperature. Then the mixture was allowed to cool to room
temperature and was transferred to a separating funnel.
10 mL of de-ionized water were added, which led to the
formation of two phases. Aer emulsification by means of shaking, the phases were allowed to separate and the aqueous
phase containing the IONP bearing GA-PEG was collected.
This step was repeated until all nanocubes were transferred
into water. After the solution was concentrated under reduced

2.5 h (a shorter “ageing time” at 200 C led to lower reproducibility as well as to broadening of the size and shape distributions of the nal particles). The temperature was then increased at a heating rate of 7 C / min up to 310 C or reflux temperature
and maintained at this value for 1 h. After cooling down
to room temperature, 60 mL of acetone were added and the
solution was centrifuged at 8500 rpm. The supernatant was then discarded and the black precipitate was dispersed in 2–3 mL of chloroform: this washing procedure was repeated at least two more times. Finally, the collected particles were dispersed in
15 mL of chloroform. By varying the ratio between DBE and
squalane, while keeping the other parameters constant, smaller
particles could be synthesized. For instance, 38  4 nm, 26
3 nm, 21  2 nm and 14  2 nm nanocubes were synthesized by
using 21 mL of squalane and 4 mL of DBE, 18 mL of squalane
and 7 mL of DBE, 16 mL of squalane and 9 mL of DBE and 23 mL of DBE and 2 mL of squalane, respectively (Fig. 2 and S1†). It is
also worth underlining the importance of the vacuum step, as we
found the system to be very sensitive to moisture/air. In all the syntheses, we applied vacuum for 120 minutes at 0.1 mbar and at
a temperature of 65C. 

 2) Transfer of iron oxide nanocrystals into polar solvents
After reducing the temperature of the reaction
mixture from 310 to 70 C, 15 mL GA-PEG solution (0.1 M in
chloroform containing 1 mL triethylamine) was injected and
the resulting mixture was stirred overnight at constant
temperature. Then the mixture was allowed to cool to room
temperature and was transferred to a separating funnel.
10 mL of de-ionized water were added, which led to the
formation of two phases. Aer emulsification by means of shaking, the phases were allowed to separate and the aqueous
phase containing the IONP bearing GA-PEG was collected.
This step was repeated until all nanocubes were transferred
into water. After the solution was concentrated under reduced
pressure at 40 C to a nal volume of about 50 mL, the excess
of GA-PEG was removed by dialysis versus 5 L de-ionized water,
using cellulose membrane tubing with a pore size of 50 kDa.
The sample was le in dialysis overnight at room temperature.
This step was repeated 5 times. Finally, the nanocube solution
was concentrated by centrifugation in a centrifuge aflter
(molecular cut-off point 100 kDa) and analysed by FTIR, DLS,

mixture from 310 to 70 C, 15 mL GA-PEG solution (0.1 M in
chloroform containing 1 mL triethylamine) was injected and
the resulting mixture was stirred overnight at constant
temperature. Then the mixture was allowed to cool to room
temperature and was transferred to a separating funnel.
10 mL of de-ionized water were added, which led to the
formation of two phases. Aer emulsification by means of shaking, the phases were allowed to separate and the aqueous
phase containing the IONP bearing GA-PEG was collected.
This step was repeated until all nanocubes were transferred
into water. After the solution was concentrated under reduced
pressure at 40 C to a nal volume of about 50 mL, the excess
of GA-PEG was removed by dialysis versus 5 L de-ionized water,
using cellulose membrane tubing with a pore size of 50 kDa.
The sample was le in dialysis overnight at room temperature.
This step was repeated 5 times. Finally, the nanocube solution
was concentrated by centrifugation in a centrifuge aflter
(molecular cut-off point 100 kDa) and analysed by FTIR, DLS,
TEM and TGA.",,,,,,,,,,,,,TEM,200.000,,,24.000,24.000,24.000,24.000,cube,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,300.000,70.000,75.000,7.000,,,,,,,,,,,,252.657,0.220,680.272,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ether/squalane ratio
Briefly, in a 50 mL three neck flask, 0.353 g (1 mmol) of
iron(III) acetylacetonate with 0.69 g (4 mmols) of decanoic acid
and 3 mL of dibenzyl ether (DBE) were dissolved in 22 mL of
squalane. After degassing for 120 minutes at 65 C, the mixture
was heated up to 200 C (3 C /min
) and kept at this value for
2.5 h (a shorter “ageing time” at 200 C led to lower reproducibility as well as to broadening of the size and shape distributions of the nal particles). The temperature was then increased at a heating rate of 7 C / min up to 310 C or reflux temperature
and maintained at this value for 1 h. After cooling down
to room temperature, 60 mL of acetone were added and the
solution was centrifuged at 8500 rpm. The supernatant was then discarded and the black precipitate was dispersed in 2–3 mL of chloroform: this washing procedure was repeated at least two more times. Finally, the collected particles were dispersed in
15 mL of chloroform. By varying the ratio between DBE and
squalane, while keeping the other parameters constant, smaller
particles could be synthesized. For instance, 38  4 nm, 26
3 nm, 21  2 nm and 14  2 nm nanocubes were synthesized by
using 21 mL of squalane and 4 mL of DBE, 18 mL of squalane
and 7 mL of DBE, 16 mL of squalane and 9 mL of DBE and 23 mL of DBE and 2 mL of squalane, respectively (Fig. 2 and S1†). It is
also worth underlining the importance of the vacuum step, as we
found the system to be very sensitive to moisture/air. In all the syntheses, we applied vacuum for 120 minutes at 0.1 mbar and at
a temperature of 65C.

ether/squalane ratio
Briefly, in a 50 mL three neck flask, 0.353 g (1 mmol) of
iron(III) acetylacetonate with 0.69 g (4 mmols) of decanoic acid
and 3 mL of dibenzyl ether (DBE) were dissolved in 22 mL of
squalane. After degassing for 120 minutes at 65 C, the mixture
was heated up to 200 C (3 C /min
) and kept at this value for
2.5 h (a shorter “ageing time” at 200 C led to lower reproducibility as well as to broadening of the size and shape distributions of the nal particles). The temperature was then increased at a heating rate of 7 C / min up to 310 C or reflux temperature
and maintained at this value for 1 h. After cooling down
to room temperature, 60 mL of acetone were added and the
solution was centrifuged at 8500 rpm. The supernatant was then discarded and the black precipitate was dispersed in 2–3 mL of chloroform: this washing procedure was repeated at least two more times. Finally, the collected particles were dispersed in
15 mL of chloroform. By varying the ratio between DBE and
squalane, while keeping the other parameters constant, smaller
particles could be synthesized. For instance, 38  4 nm, 26
3 nm, 21  2 nm and 14  2 nm nanocubes were synthesized by
using 21 mL of squalane and 4 mL of DBE, 18 mL of squalane
and 7 mL of DBE, 16 mL of squalane and 9 mL of DBE and 23 mL of DBE and 2 mL of squalane, respectively (Fig. 2 and S1†). It is
also worth underlining the importance of the vacuum step, as we
found the system to be very sensitive to moisture/air. In all the syntheses, we applied vacuum for 120 minutes at 0.1 mbar and at
a temperature of 65C. 

 2) Transfer of iron oxide nanocrystals into polar solvents
After reducing the temperature of the reaction
mixture from 310 to 70 C, 15 mL GA-PEG solution (0.1 M in
chloroform containing 1 mL triethylamine) was injected and
the resulting mixture was stirred overnight at constant
temperature. Then the mixture was allowed to cool to room
temperature and was transferred to a separating funnel.
10 mL of de-ionized water were added, which led to the
formation of two phases. Aer emulsification by means of shaking, the phases were allowed to separate and the aqueous
phase containing the IONP bearing GA-PEG was collected.
This step was repeated until all nanocubes were transferred
into water. After the solution was concentrated under reduced
pressure at 40 C to a nal volume of about 50 mL, the excess
of GA-PEG was removed by dialysis versus 5 L de-ionized water,
using cellulose membrane tubing with a pore size of 50 kDa.
The sample was le in dialysis overnight at room temperature.

solution was centrifuged at 8500 rpm. The supernatant was then discarded and the black precipitate was dispersed in 2–3 mL of chloroform: this washing procedure was repeated at least two more times. Finally, the collected particles were dispersed in
15 mL of chloroform. By varying the ratio between DBE and
squalane, while keeping the other parameters constant, smaller
particles could be synthesized. For instance, 38  4 nm, 26
3 nm, 21  2 nm and 14  2 nm nanocubes were synthesized by
using 21 mL of squalane and 4 mL of DBE, 18 mL of squalane
and 7 mL of DBE, 16 mL of squalane and 9 mL of DBE and 23 mL of DBE and 2 mL of squalane, respectively (Fig. 2 and S1†). It is
also worth underlining the importance of the vacuum step, as we
found the system to be very sensitive to moisture/air. In all the syntheses, we applied vacuum for 120 minutes at 0.1 mbar and at
a temperature of 65C. 

 2) Transfer of iron oxide nanocrystals into polar solvents
After reducing the temperature of the reaction
mixture from 310 to 70 C, 15 mL GA-PEG solution (0.1 M in
chloroform containing 1 mL triethylamine) was injected and
the resulting mixture was stirred overnight at constant
temperature. Then the mixture was allowed to cool to room
temperature and was transferred to a separating funnel.
10 mL of de-ionized water were added, which led to the
formation of two phases. Aer emulsification by means of shaking, the phases were allowed to separate and the aqueous
phase containing the IONP bearing GA-PEG was collected.
This step was repeated until all nanocubes were transferred
into water. After the solution was concentrated under reduced
pressure at 40 C to a nal volume of about 50 mL, the excess
of GA-PEG was removed by dialysis versus 5 L de-ionized water,
using cellulose membrane tubing with a pore size of 50 kDa.
The sample was le in dialysis overnight at room temperature.
This step was repeated 5 times. Finally, the nanocube solution
was concentrated by centrifugation in a centrifuge aflter
(molecular cut-off point 100 kDa) and analysed by FTIR, DLS,

12 nm particles: To synthesize small cube-shaped IONCs of about 12 nm in edge length (see Figure 1A), 0.353 g (1 mmol) of iron(III) acetylacetonate was mixed with 0.69 g (4 mmol) of decanoic acid in 25 mL of dibenzyl ether.

After 2.5 h at 200 C, the solution was heated to reflux temperature at a heating rate of 10 C/min and kept at this temperature for 1 h. After cooling to room temperature, 60 mL of acetone was added and the whole solution was centrifuged at 8500 rpm. After removing the supernatant, the black precipitate was dispersed in 23 mL of chloroform and the washing procedure was repeated at least two more times.

After degassing at room temperature for 45 min, the solution was heated to 200 C (5 C/min) and kept at this temperature for 2.5 h. Finally, the temperature was increased to reflux temperature (at a rate of 10 C/min) and kept at this value for 1 h. After cooling to room temperature, the particles were collected by adding a 4-fold volume of acetone/chloroform and centrifuged at 8000 rpm. As for the 12 nm particles, the sample was washed three times and dispersed in 15 mL of chloroform.
25 nm particles: Larger nanocubes of about 25 nm in edge length (see Figure 1C) were obtained by slightly decreasing the molar ratio of the iron(III) acetylacetonate to decanoic acid as follows: 0.353 g (1 mmol) of iron(III) acetylacetonate, 0.69 g (4 mmol) of decanoic acid, and 25 mL of dibenzyl ether were mixed together in a 50 mL three-neck round-bottom flask.

12 nm particles: To synthesize small cube-shaped IONCs of about 12 nm in edge length (see Figure 1A), 0.353 g (1 mmol) of iron(III) acetylacetonate was mixed with 0.69 g (4 mmol) of decanoic acid in 25 mL of dibenzyl ether. After degassing for 1 h at 60 C, the solution was heated to 200 C (at a rate of 5 C/min) under argon with vigorous stirring. After 2.5 h at 200 C, the solution was heated to reflux temperature at a heating rate of 10 C/min and kept at this temperature for 1 h. After cooling to room temperature, 60 mL of acetone was added and the whole solution was centrifuged at 8500 rpm. After removing the supernatant, the black precipitate was dispersed in 23 mL of chloroform and the washing procedure was repeated at least two more times. Finally, the collected particles were dispersed in 15 mL of chloroform.

After degassing at room temperature for 45 min, the solution was heated to 200 C (5 C/min) and kept at this temperature for 2.5 h. Finally, the temperature was increased to reflux temperature (at a rate of 10 C/min) and kept at this value for 1 h. After cooling to room temperature, the particles were collected by adding a 4-fold volume of acetone/chloroform and centrifuged at 8000 rpm. As for the 12 nm particles, the sample was washed three times and dispersed in 15 mL of chloroform.
25 nm particles: Larger nanocubes of about 25 nm in edge length (see Figure 1C) were obtained by slightly decreasing the molar ratio of the iron(III) acetylacetonate to decanoic acid as follows: 0.353 g (1 mmol) of iron(III) acetylacetonate, 0.69 g (4 mmol) of decanoic acid, and 25 mL of dibenzyl ether were mixed together in a 50 mL three-neck round-bottom flask. Following the same procedure as for 19 nm nanocubes, after degassing for 45 min at room temperature, the solution was heated to 200 C and kept at this temperature for 2.5 h. In a second step, the solution was heated to reflux temperature (at a rate of 6 C/min) and kept at this value for 1 h. The solution was always under an argon flow and under vigorous stirring. Particles were washed following the same procedure men- tioned above and dispersed in 15 mL of chloroform.
38 nm particles: The largest particles of 38 nm in edge length (see Figure 1D) were synthesized by mixing 0.353 g (1 mmol) of iron(III) acetylacetonate with 0.69 g (4 mmol) of decanoic acid in 25 mL of dibenzyl ether. After degassing for 90 min at room temperature, the mixture was heated to 200 C (at a rate of 15 C/min) and kept at this value for 2.5 h. Finally, the temperature was increased at a heating rate of 4 C/min until reflux and maintained at this value for 1 h.

12 nm particles: To synthesize small cube-shaped IONCs of about 12 nm in edge length (see Figure 1A), 0.353 g (1 mmol) of iron(III) acetylacetonate was mixed with 0.69 g (4 mmol) of decanoic acid in 25 mL of dibenzyl ether. After degassing for 1 h at 60 C, the solution was heated to 200 C (at a rate of 5 C/min) under argon with vigorous stirring. After 2.5 h at 200 C, the solution was heated to reflux temperature at a heating rate of 10 C/min and kept at this temperature for 1 h. After cooling to room temperature, 60 mL of acetone was added and the whole solution was centrifuged at 8500 rpm. After removing the supernatant, the black precipitate was dispersed in 23 mL of chloroform and the washing procedure was repeated at least two more times. Finally, the collected particles were dispersed in 15 mL of chloroform.

After degassing at room temperature for 45 min, the solution was heated to 200 C (5 C/min) and kept at this temperature for 2.5 h. Finally, the temperature was increased to reflux temperature (at a rate of 10 C/min) and kept at this value for 1 h. After cooling to room temperature, the particles were collected by adding a 4-fold volume of acetone/chloroform and centrifuged at 8000 rpm. As for the 12 nm particles, the sample was washed three times and dispersed in 15 mL of chloroform.
25 nm particles: Larger nanocubes of about 25 nm in edge length (see Figure 1C) were obtained by slightly decreasing the molar ratio of the iron(III) acetylacetonate to decanoic acid as follows: 0.353 g (1 mmol) of iron(III) acetylacetonate, 0.69 g (4 mmol) of decanoic acid, and 25 mL of dibenzyl ether were mixed together in a 50 mL three-neck round-bottom flask. Following the same procedure as for 19 nm nanocubes, after degassing for 45 min at room temperature, the solution was heated to 200 C and kept at this temperature for 2.5 h. In a second step, the solution was heated to reflux temperature (at a rate of 6 C/min) and kept at this value for 1 h. The solution was always under an argon flow and under vigorous stirring. Particles were washed following the same procedure men- tioned above and dispersed in 15 mL of chloroform.
38 nm particles: The largest particles of 38 nm in edge length (see Figure 1D) were synthesized by mixing 0.353 g (1 mmol) of iron(III) acetylacetonate with 0.69 g (4 mmol) of decanoic acid in 25 mL of dibenzyl ether. After degassing for 90 min at room temperature, the mixture was heated to 200 C (at a rate of 15 C/min) and kept at this value for 2.5 h.

12 nm particles: To synthesize small cube-shaped IONCs of about 12 nm in edge length (see Figure 1A), 0.353 g (1 mmol) of iron(III) acetylacetonate was mixed with 0.69 g (4 mmol) of decanoic acid in 25 mL of dibenzyl ether. After degassing for 1 h at 60 C, the solution was heated to 200 C (at a rate of 5 C/min) under argon with vigorous stirring. After 2.5 h at 200 C, the solution was heated to reflux temperature at a heating rate of 10 C/min and kept at this temperature for 1 h. After cooling to room temperature, 60 mL of acetone was added and the whole solution was centrifuged at 8500 rpm. After removing the supernatant, the black precipitate was dispersed in 23 mL of chloroform and the washing procedure was repeated at least two more times. Finally, the collected particles were dispersed in 15 mL of chloroform.
19 nm particles: To synthesize iron oxide nanocubes of about 19 nm in edge length (Figure 1B), 0.353 g (1 mmol) of iron(III) acetylacetonate and 0.69 g (4 mmol) of decanoic acid were mixed in 25 mL of dibenzyl ether. After degassing at room temperature for 45 min, the solution was heated to 200 C (5 C/min) and kept at this temperature for 2.5 h. Finally, the temperature was increased to reflux temperature (at a rate of 10 C/min) and kept at this value for 1 h. After cooling to room temperature, the particles were collected by adding a 4-fold volume of acetone/chloroform and centrifuged at 8000 rpm. As for the 12 nm particles, the sample was washed three times and dispersed in 15 mL of chloroform.
25 nm particles: Larger nanocubes of about 25 nm in edge length (see Figure 1C) were obtained by slightly decreasing the molar ratio of the iron(III) acetylacetonate to decanoic acid as follows: 0.353 g (1 mmol) of iron(III) acetylacetonate, 0.69 g (4 mmol) of decanoic acid, and 25 mL of dibenzyl ether were mixed together in a 50 mL three-neck round-bottom flask. Following the same procedure as for 19 nm nanocubes, after degassing for 45 min at room temperature, the solution was heated to 200 C and kept at this temperature for 2.5 h. In a second step, the solution was heated to reflux temperature (at a rate of 6 C/min) and kept at this value for 1 h. The solution was always under an argon flow and under vigorous stirring. Particles were washed following the same procedure men- tioned above and dispersed in 15 mL of chloroform.
38 nm particles: The largest particles of 38 nm in edge length (see Figure 1D) were synthesized by mixing 0.353 g (1 mmol) of iron(III) acetylacetonate with 0.69 g (4 mmol) of decanoic acid in 25 mL of dibenzyl ether. After degassing for 90 min at room temperature, the mixture was heated to 200 C (at a rate of 15 C/min) and kept at this value for 2.5 h. Finally, the temperature was increased at a heating rate of 4 C/min until reflux and maintained at this value for 1 h.

After cooling to room temperature, 60 mL of acetone was added and the whole solution was centrifuged at 8500 rpm. After removing the supernatant, the black precipitate was dispersed in 23 mL of chloroform and the washing procedure was repeated at least two more times.

25 nm particles: Larger nanocubes of about 25 nm in edge length (see Figure 1C) were obtained by slightly decreasing the molar ratio of the iron(III) acetylacetonate to decanoic acid as follows: 0.353 g (1 mmol) of iron(III) acetylacetonate, 0.69 g (4 mmol) of decanoic acid, and 25 mL of dibenzyl ether were mixed together in a 50 mL three-neck round-bottom flask. Following the same procedure as for 19 nm nanocubes, after degassing for 45 min at room temperature, the solution was heated to 200 C and kept at this temperature for 2.5 h.

12 nm particles: To synthesize small cube-shaped IONCs of about 12 nm in edge length (see Figure 1A), 0.353 g (1 mmol) of iron(III) acetylacetonate was mixed with 0.69 g (4 mmol) of decanoic acid in 25 mL of dibenzyl ether. After degassing for 1 h at 60 C, the solution was heated to 200 C (at a rate of 5 C/min) under argon with vigorous stirring. After 2.5 h at 200 C, the solution was heated to reflux temperature at a heating rate of 10 C/min and kept at this temperature for 1 h. After cooling to room temperature, 60 mL of acetone was added and the whole solution was centrifuged at 8500 rpm. After removing the supernatant, the black precipitate was dispersed in 23 mL of chloroform and the washing procedure was repeated at least two more times. Finally, the collected particles were dispersed in 15 mL of chloroform.
19 nm particles: To synthesize iron oxide nanocubes of about 19 nm in edge length (Figure 1B), 0.353 g (1 mmol) of iron(III) acetylacetonate and 0.69 g (4 mmol) of decanoic acid were mixed in 25 mL of dibenzyl ether.

Finally, the temperature was increased to reflux temperature (at a rate of 10 C/min) and kept at this value for 1 h. After cooling to room temperature, the particles were collected by adding a 4-fold volume of acetone/chloroform and centrifuged at 8000 rpm. As for the 12 nm particles, the sample was washed three times and dispersed in 15 mL of chloroform.
25 nm particles: Larger nanocubes of about 25 nm in edge length (see Figure 1C) were obtained by slightly decreasing the molar ratio of the iron(III) acetylacetonate to decanoic acid as follows: 0.353 g (1 mmol) of iron(III) acetylacetonate, 0.69 g (4 mmol) of decanoic acid, and 25 mL of dibenzyl ether were mixed together in a 50 mL three-neck round-bottom flask. Following the same procedure as for 19 nm nanocubes, after degassing for 45 min at room temperature, the solution was heated to 200 C and kept at this temperature for 2.5 h. In a second step, the solution was heated to reflux temperature (at a rate of 6 C/min) and kept at this value for 1 h. The solution was always under an argon flow and under vigorous stirring. Particles were washed following the same procedure men- tioned above and dispersed in 15 mL of chloroform.

After degassing for 90 min at room temperature, the mixture was heated to 200 C (at a rate of 15 C/min) and kept at this value for 2.5 h.

Additionally, with these nanoparticles, the amount of iron necessary to reach an equilibrium temperature in the range between 40 and 45 C (which is considered the appropriate temperature range to obtain a therapeutic effect) was estimated at 4 g/L, which might be useful for reducing the in vivo dose of IONC needed: so far, to reach in vivo the same temperature, 2 orders of magnitude more material have been used.15,54 For the cube-shaped IONCs exhibiting this heating ef- fect, a corresponding in vitro mortality attested around 50% was estimated after 1 h of treatment, with corresponding necrotic damage to the cells. As a next step, in vivo animal tests are under investiga- tion in order to establish their efficacy on a tumor model.
12 nm particles: To synthesize small cube-shaped IONCs of about 12 nm in edge length (see Figure 1A), 0.353 g (1 mmol) of iron(III) acetylacetonate was mixed with 0.69 g (4 mmol) of decanoic acid in 25 mL of dibenzyl ether. After degassing for 1 h at 60 C, the solution was heated to 200 C (at a rate of 5 C/min) under argon with vigorous stirring. After 2.5 h at 200 C, the solution was heated to reflux temperature at a heating rate of 10 C/min and kept at this temperature for 1 h. After cooling to room temperature, 60 mL of acetone was added and the whole solution was centrifuged at 8500 rpm. After removing the supernatant, the black precipitate was dispersed in 23 mL of chloroform and the washing procedure was repeated at least two more times. Finally, the collected particles were dispersed in 15 mL of chloroform.
19 nm particles: To synthesize iron oxide nanocubes of about 19 nm in edge length (Figure 1B), 0.353 g (1 mmol) of iron(III) acetylacetonate and 0.69 g (4 mmol) of decanoic acid were mixed in 25 mL of dibenzyl ether. After degassing at room temperature for 45 min, the solution was heated to 200 C (5 C/min) and kept at this temperature for 2.5 h. Finally, the temperature was increased to reflux temperature (at a rate of 10 C/min) and kept at this value for 1 h. After cooling to room temperature, the particles were collected by adding a 4-fold volume of acetone/chloroform and centrifuged at 8000 rpm. As for the 12 nm particles, the sample was washed three times and dispersed in 15 mL of chloroform.
25 nm particles: Larger nanocubes of about 25 nm in edge length (see Figure 1C) were obtained by slightly decreasing the molar ratio of the iron(III) acetylacetonate to decanoic acid as follows: 0.353 g (1 mmol) of iron(III) acetylacetonate, 0.69 g (4 mmol) of decanoic acid, and 25 mL of dibenzyl ether were mixed together in a 50 mL three-neck round-bottom flask. Following the same procedure as for 19 nm nanocubes, after degassing for 45 min at room temperature, the solution was heated to 200 C and kept at this temperature for 2.5 h. In a second step, the solution was heated to reflux temperature (at a rate of 6 C/min) and kept at this value for 1 h. The solution was always under an argon flow and under vigorous stirring. Particles were washed following the same procedure men- tioned above and dispersed in 15 mL of chloroform.
38 nm particles: The largest particles of 38 nm in edge length (see Figure 1D) were synthesized by mixing 0.353 g (1 mmol) of iron(III) acetylacetonate with 0.69 g (4 mmol) of decanoic acid in 25 mL of dibenzyl ether. After degassing for 90 min at room temperature, the mixture was heated to 200 C (at a rate of 15 C/min) and kept at this value for 2.5 h. Finally, the temperature was increased at a heating rate of 4 C/min until reflux and maintained at this value for 1 h. After cooling to room temperature, the particles were washed by following the above- mentioned procedure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,TEM,100.000,,,38.000,38.000,38.000,38.000,hexagonal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,264.600,0.700,225.287,,no toxic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The synthesis of iron oxide nanocubes over a wide range of sizes is not straightforward. The experimental conditions re- ported here should be taken as a starting point, then many parameters influence the final size and shape. In our case, the following conditions were the most suitable ones for synthesiz- ing cubes of 12, 19, 25, and 38 nm.
tested. The square dependence of the SAR as a func- tion of the magnetic field amplitude and the linear dependence of the SAR values recorded as a function of the frequency allowed us to assess that, in order to achieve higher efficient hyperthermia treatment by using the same amount of magnetic nanoparticles, it is advisible to apply lower frequencies and higher magnetic field amplitudes. From the technical point of view, this represents an advantage as it is easier to apply a higher magnetic field amplitude at a lower frequency. It is also worth underlining that significant SAR values have been achieved for these cube-shaped IONCs at frequency and magnetic field conditions that are considered biomedically safe.

The synthesis of iron oxide nanocubes over a wide range of sizes is not straightforward. The experimental conditions re- ported here should be taken as a starting point, then many parameters influence the final size and shape. In our case, the following conditions were the most suitable ones for synthesiz- ing cubes of 12, 19, 25, and 38 nm.
tested. The square dependence of the SAR as a func- tion of the magnetic field amplitude and the linear dependence of the SAR values recorded as a function of the frequency allowed us to assess that, in order to achieve higher efficient hyperthermia treatment by using the same amount of magnetic nanoparticles, it is advisible to apply lower frequencies and higher magnetic field amplitudes. From the technical point of view, this represents an advantage as it is easier to apply a higher magnetic field amplitude at a lower frequency. It is also worth underlining that significant SAR values have been achieved for these cube-shaped IONCs at frequency and magnetic field conditions that are considered biomedically safe.
Furthermore, hyperthermia experiments performed on tumor KB cells by employing the 19 nm cube- shaped IONCs allowed us to assess that these nano- crystals are still able to function as heat probes at 110 kHz and 20 kAm1, even when internalized by the cells in endosomal compartments. Additionally, with these nanoparticles, the amount of iron necessary to reach an equilibrium temperature in the range between 40 and 45 C (which is considered the appropriate temperature range to obtain a therapeutic effect) was estimated at 4 g/L, which might be useful for reducing the in vivo dose of IONC needed: so far, to reach in vivo the same temperature, 2 orders of magnitude more material have been used.15,54 For the cube-shaped IONCs exhibiting this heating ef- fect, a corresponding in vitro mortality attested around 50% was estimated after 1 h of treatment, with corresponding necrotic damage to the cells. As a next step, in vivo animal tests are under investiga- tion in order to establish their efficacy on a tumor model.
12 nm particles: To synthesize small cube-shaped IONCs of about 12 nm in edge length (see Figure 1A), 0.353 g (1 mmol) of iron(III) acetylacetonate was mixed with 0.69 g (4 mmol) of decanoic acid in 25 mL of dibenzyl ether. After degassing for 1 h at 60 C, the solution was heated to 200 C (at a rate of 5 C/min) under argon with vigorous stirring. After 2.5 h at 200 C, the solution was heated to reflux temperature at a heating rate of 10 C/min and kept at this temperature for 1 h. After cooling to room temperature, 60 mL of acetone was added and the whole solution was centrifuged at 8500 rpm. After removing the supernatant, the black precipitate was dispersed in 23 mL of chloroform and the washing procedure was repeated at least two more times. Finally, the collected particles were dispersed in 15 mL of chloroform.
19 nm particles: To synthesize iron oxide nanocubes of about 19 nm in edge length (Figure 1B), 0.353 g (1 mmol) of iron(III) acetylacetonate and 0.69 g (4 mmol) of decanoic acid were mixed in 25 mL of dibenzyl ether. After degassing at room temperature for 45 min, the solution was heated to 200 C (5 C/min) and kept at this temperature for 2.5 h. Finally, the temperature was increased to reflux temperature (at a rate of 10 C/min) and kept at this value for 1 h. After cooling to room temperature, the particles were collected by adding a 4-fold volume of acetone/chloroform and centrifuged at 8000 rpm. As for the 12 nm particles, the sample was washed three times and dispersed in 15 mL of chloroform.
25 nm particles: Larger nanocubes of about 25 nm in edge length (see Figure 1C) were obtained by slightly decreasing the molar ratio of the iron(III) acetylacetonate to decanoic acid as follows: 0.353 g (1 mmol) of iron(III) acetylacetonate, 0.69 g (4 mmol) of decanoic acid, and 25 mL of dibenzyl ether were mixed together in a 50 mL three-neck round-bottom flask. Following the same procedure as for 19 nm nanocubes, after degassing for 45 min at room temperature, the solution was heated to 200 C and kept at this temperature for 2.5 h. In a second step, the solution was heated to reflux temperature (at a rate of 6 C/min) and kept at this value for 1 h. The solution was always under an argon flow and under vigorous stirring. Particles were washed following the same procedure men- tioned above and dispersed in 15 mL of chloroform.
38 nm particles: The largest particles of 38 nm in edge length (see Figure 1D) were synthesized by mixing 0.353 g (1 mmol) of iron(III) acetylacetonate with 0.69 g (4 mmol) of decanoic acid in 25 mL of dibenzyl ether. After degassing for 90 min at room temperature, the mixture was heated to 200 C (at a rate of 15 C/min) and kept at this value for 2.5 h. Finally, the temperature was increased at a heating rate of 4 C/min until reflux and maintained at this value for 1 h.

The above solution was heated to 55 °C and stirred for 30 min to ensure formation of a clear solution. After that, the solution was cooled to room temperature, where 4 mL of iron pentacarbonyl was added and magnetically stirred for another 60 min. Then, the solution was transferred to a 45 mL autoclave with a Teflon lining and heated to 200 °C for 6 h under autogenous pressure. After cooling to room temperature, the black precipitate was washed with ethanol thrice and transferred to hexane for storing. As-prepared oleic acid- coated iron oxide nanorods were dried in air. 100 mg of dried powder was dispersed in 10 mL of ethanol containing 500 mg of tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH). The ratio of particles/ethanol/TMAH was kept 1:10:5 in all the cases. The above solution was sonicated for 30 min followed by washing with water. After washing, the obtained nanorods were dispersed in water. The morphology and the size of the nanorods showed no variation due to the phase transferring of the nanorods from organic to aqueous medium.",,,,,,,,,,cristaline,,,TEM,60.000,,,,65.000,5.700,5.700,nanorod,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,298.000,50.000,88.302,0.000,0.000,,,,2.957,330.100,20.000,116.842,,,,600.000,0.310,670.000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The square dependence of the SAR as a func- tion of the magnetic field amplitude and the linear dependence of the SAR values recorded as a function of the frequency allowed us to assess that, in order to achieve higher efficient hyperthermia treatment by using the same amount of magnetic nanoparticles, it is advisible to apply lower frequencies and higher magnetic field amplitudes. From the technical point of view, this represents an advantage as it is easier to apply a higher magnetic field amplitude at a lower frequency. It is also worth underlining that significant SAR values have been achieved for these cube-shaped IONCs at frequency and magnetic field conditions that are considered biomedically safe.
Furthermore, hyperthermia experiments performed on tumor KB cells by employing the 19 nm cube- shaped IONCs allowed us to assess that these nano- crystals are still able to function as heat probes at 110 kHz and 20 kAm1, even when internalized by the cells in endosomal compartments. Additionally, with these nanoparticles, the amount of iron necessary to reach an equilibrium temperature in the range between 40 and 45 C (which is considered the appropriate temperature range to obtain a therapeutic effect) was estimated at 4 g/L, which might be useful for reducing the in vivo dose of IONC needed: so far, to reach in vivo the same temperature, 2 orders of magnitude more material have been used.15,54 For the cube-shaped IONCs exhibiting this heating ef- fect, a corresponding in vitro mortality attested around 50% was estimated after 1 h of treatment, with corresponding necrotic damage to the cells.

12 nm particles: To synthesize small cube-shaped IONCs of about 12 nm in edge length (see Figure 1A), 0.353 g (1 mmol) of iron(III) acetylacetonate was mixed with 0.69 g (4 mmol) of decanoic acid in 25 mL of dibenzyl ether. After degassing for 1 h at 60 C, the solution was heated to 200 C (at a rate of 5 C/min) under argon with vigorous stirring. After 2.5 h at 200 C, the solution was heated to reflux temperature at a heating rate of 10 C/min and kept at this temperature for 1 h. After cooling to room temperature, 60 mL of acetone was added and the whole solution was centrifuged at 8500 rpm. After removing the supernatant, the black precipitate was dispersed in 23 mL of chloroform and the washing procedure was repeated at least two more times. Finally, the collected particles were dispersed in 15 mL of chloroform.
19 nm particles: To synthesize iron oxide nanocubes of about 19 nm in edge length (Figure 1B), 0.353 g (1 mmol) of iron(III) acetylacetonate and 0.69 g (4 mmol) of decanoic acid were mixed in 25 mL of dibenzyl ether. After degassing at room temperature for 45 min, the solution was heated to 200 C (5 C/min) and kept at this temperature for 2.5 h. Finally, the temperature was increased to reflux temperature (at a rate of 10 C/min) and kept at this value for 1 h. After cooling to room temperature, the particles were collected by adding a 4-fold volume of acetone/chloroform and centrifuged at 8000 rpm. As for the 12 nm particles, the sample was washed three times and dispersed in 15 mL of chloroform.
25 nm particles: Larger nanocubes of about 25 nm in edge length (see Figure 1C) were obtained by slightly decreasing the molar ratio of the iron(III) acetylacetonate to decanoic acid as follows: 0.353 g (1 mmol) of iron(III) acetylacetonate, 0.69 g (4 mmol) of decanoic acid, and 25 mL of dibenzyl ether were mixed together in a 50 mL three-neck round-bottom flask. Following the same procedure as for 19 nm nanocubes, after degassing for 45 min at room temperature, the solution was heated to 200 C and kept at this temperature for 2.5 h. In a second step, the solution was heated to reflux temperature (at a rate of 6 C/min) and kept at this value for 1 h. The solution was always under an argon flow and under vigorous stirring. Particles were washed following the same procedure men- tioned above and dispersed in 15 mL of chloroform.
38 nm particles: The largest particles of 38 nm in edge length (see Figure 1D) were synthesized by mixing 0.353 g (1 mmol) of iron(III) acetylacetonate with 0.69 g (4 mmol) of decanoic acid in 25 mL of dibenzyl ether. After degassing for 90 min at room temperature, the mixture was heated to 200 C (at a rate of 15 C/min) and kept at this value for 2.5 h. Finally, the temperature was increased at a heating rate of 4 C/min until reflux and maintained at this value for 1 h.

nanoparticles (using x = 0.43 as example) is as follows: 0.903 g (1 mmol) of iron oleate (synthesized
in a typical method) and 0.104 g (0.167 mmol) manganese oleate were dissolved in 15mL of
1-octadecene, with the addition of 0.186 mL (0.584 mmol) of oleic acid. The solution was first kept
at 120 °C for 30 min in vacuum to remove air and other impurities then refluxed at 320 °C in N2 for
2 h before cooling to room temperature. The products were separated by centrifugation, washed three
times with ethanol, and dispersed in hexane for further use. The preparation of Fe3O4 nanoparticles is
similar to the procedure without the adding of manganese oleate.",thermal decomposition,,,,,,,,,crystalline,inverse spinel structures of magnetite,,TEM,,-,0.300,18.500,18.500,18.500,18.500,spherical,,,,,,,,,MTT,SMMC-7721,no,100.000,,,,,,,,,300.000,50000.000,75.600,0.000,0.000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7.000,0.500,904.400,,,,,,,,,,,,,
