nanoparticles (using x = 0.43 as example) is as follows: 0.903 g (1 mmol) of iron oleate (synthesized
in a typical method) and 0.104 g (0.167 mmol) manganese oleate were dissolved in 15mL of
1-octadecene, with the addition of 0.186 mL (0.584 mmol) of oleic acid. The solution was first kept
at 120 °C for 30 min in vacuum to remove air and other impurities then refluxed at 320 °C in N2 for
2 h before cooling to room temperature. The products were separated by centrifugation, washed three
times with ethanol, and dispersed in hexane for further use. The preparation of Fe3O4 nanoparticles is
similar to the procedure without the adding of manganese oleate.",thermal decomposition,,,,,,,,,crystalline,inverse spinel structures of magnetite,,TEM,,-,0.300,18.500,18.500,18.500,18.500,spherical,,,,,,,,,MTT,SMMC-7721,no,100.000,,,,,,,,,300.000,50000.000,75.600,0.000,0.000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7.000,0.500,904.400,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gd(acac)3 (0.5 g) was added into diethylene glycol (50 mL) and
stirred at 80 °C for 30 min. Then, Fe3O4@PEI was dispersed into the
solution with stirring for 30 min. Next, triethanolamine (3 mL) was
added into the resulting solution at 80 °C for 30 min. After that, the
mixture solution was transferred into the Teflon-lined stainless steel
autoclaves and kept at 200 °C for 3 days. The obtained product
(YFGN) was collected and washed with water and alcohol at least
three times. YFGN (32 mg) was dispersed
into CDDP solution (6 mL, 2 mg/mL) and shaken at room
temperature for 24 h, so that CDDP could be loaded into YFGN. After
centrifuging at 11,000 rpm for 8 min, the residual CDDP in the
supernatant was determined using ICP-OES. The drug capacity of
YFGN-CDDP could be calculated according to our previously
reported method.32 After that, NH2-PEG-COOH (MW = 1000) was
grafted onto YFGN-CDDP via the following methods: NH2-PEGCOOH (5 mg) was reacted with NHS (5 mg) and EDC (5 mg) in
DMSO for 5 h at room temperature. Then, YFGN-CDDP (10 mg)
was added into the mixture solution and stirred overnight, and the
obtained particles (PYFGN-CDDP) were collected through centrifugation at 11,000 rpm/min.
Afterward, FA was conjugated onto the surface of PYFGN-CDDP
(5 mg) via the following methods: (1) FA (0.5 mg) was activated via
adding EDC (1 mg) and NHS (1 mg) into the DMSO solution (5
mL) at room temperature for 4 h; (2) PYFGN-CDDP was dispersed
into the mixture solution and stirred for 8 h at the same temperature.
The obtained product (FA-PYFGN-CDDP) was collected and washed
for subsequent experiments",,,,,,,,,,,Fe3O4/Gd2O3,,STEM,,,,102.000,102.000,102.000,102.000,Sphere,,,,,,,,,MTT,HeLa,,,90.000,,,,,,,,300.000,6.000,20.900,0.000,0.000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9.400,7.910,386.500,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it was maintained for another 30 min in the presence of an argon atmosphere. The heat
source was then removed, and the reaction mixture was cooled down quickly to room
temperature. Upon the addition of ethanol, a black precipitate was isolated by
centrifugation. The obtained Zn0.4F nanoparticles were then dissolved in hexane for
further use. To adjust the Zn doping level (x) in the sample, various amounts of ironeruciate complex and zinc hydroxide carbonate were used. A summary of the detailed
reaction parameters is shown in Table S1. The cation exchange reaction was then

in our previous work.13 The Au shells were prepared via a
double Au seeding approach. Small gold NPs, i.e., Au seeds,
were deposited on a SiO2
 surface in the first Au seeding step
by using the following procedure. First, to adjust the pH value
to 7, 0.1-M NaOH (anhydrous, >98%, Sigma Aldrich) was added
to 4 mL of 6.35-mM HAuCl4x3H2O (>99.9%, Alfa Aesar) in a
water solution. The amine functionalized surface of the silica
was seeded with Au(OH)3
 by mixing FePt/SiO2
 NPs with a
HAuCl4x3H2O solution and stirred at 70 °C for 5 minutes. The
colour change from yellow to orange-brown indicates the
attachment of the Au(OH)3
 to the SiO2
 surface.23 The product
was then centrifuged (950 rpm/30 min) and washed several
times and finally dispersed in distilled water. In order to
achieve denser Au seeding, i.e., fill the gaps between the Au
seeds from the first run and to obtain a more uniform Au shell,
in the second step, a Au seeding step was repeated using the
same conditions as in the first Au seeding step. Hybrid
FePt/SiO2/Au NPs were functionalized with mPEG-SH (average
Mn 6000, Sigma Aldrich) using the following procedure. Into
the suspension of hybrid NPs in water (2 mL, 5 mg) 2 mL of
mPEG-SH (0.5 mg/mL) was added. The reaction mixture was
then stirred for 30 min at 60°C. The sample was then
centrifuged (7000 rpm/10 min) and washed several times to

The SPIOs was dispersed in deionized water at 100 μg Fe/ml. The fluorescamine was mixed with the SPIO solutions in a 96-well quartz plate. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 20 minutes. The standard solutions contained DSPE- PEG-amine and 100 μg Fe/ml of the SPIOs coated with DSPE-mPEG1000 alone. The fluorescence intensity was quantified with a microplate reader (ex: 395 nm, em: 470 nm). The number of amino groups per SPIO was estimated by dividing the molar concentration of amino groups with that of the SPIOs.

After the oleate solution was cooled down to room temperature, a clear methanol solution (7.5 mL) containing 2.5 mmol NaOH and 4 mmol NH4F was added dropwise into the flask and kept stirring for at least 2 h under air condition. Then the solution was slowly heated to 70 °C to remove methanol. Under argon atmosphere, the solution was quickly heated from 70 to 305 °C (20 °C/min) and maintained at this temperature for 60 min and then cooled down to room temperature. Next, the NaHoF4 nanoparticles were precipitated with adding ethanol (∼35 mL) and centrifuged for 5 min at 5000 rpm (g-force = 2683).

The synthesis of NaDyF4 nanoparticles was similar to that of NaHoF4 nanoparticles, the main difference was that the Dy3+-oleate solution was formed at 140 °C for 30 min under vacuum, and the mixed solution was heated at 306 °C for 90 min under argon atmosphere.

The size was controlled with a molar ratio of the precursor to amine of 1 : 3 (9 nm) and 1 : 7 (4 nm), respectively. To further increase the particle size above 9 nm, a seed-mediated growth model was utilized.33 For example, the smaller nanoparticles of 6 nm were first mixed (in a different quantity of 100 mg or 150 mg) with more precursor materials and the mixture was heated as per the above procedure to achieve 12 nm and 16 nm Fe3O4 nanoparticles, respectively.

To use these samples as MRI contrast agents, the as prepared Fe3O4 NRs were subjected to surface modification with poly- ethyleneimine (using the ligand exchange approach as depicted in Fig. S1†). 100 mg of the as prepared Fe3O4 NRs were dispersed in 10 mL of toluene and mixed with 10 ml of dimethylformamide (DMF) containing 2 ml of PEI. Under an N2 atmosphere, the mixture was then continuously stirred at 80 °C for 8 h.

nanoparticles (using x = 0.43 as example) is as follows: 0.903 g (1 mmol) of iron oleate (synthesized
in a typical method) and 0.104 g (0.167 mmol) manganese oleate were dissolved in 15mL of
1-octadecene, with the addition of 0.186 mL (0.584 mmol) of oleic acid. The solution was first kept
at 120 °C for 30 min in vacuum to remove air and other impurities then refluxed at 320 °C in N2 for
2 h before cooling to room temperature. The products were separated by centrifugation, washed three
times with ethanol, and dispersed in hexane for further use. The preparation of Fe3O4 nanoparticles is
similar to the procedure without the adding of manganese oleate.",thermal decomposition,,,,,,,,,crystalline,inverse spinel structures of magnetite,,TEM,,-,0.300,18.500,18.500,18.500,18.500,spherical,,,,,,,,,MTT,SMMC-7721,no,100.000,,,,,,,,,300.000,50000.000,75.600,0.000,0.000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7.000,0.500,904.400,,,,,,,,,,,,,
